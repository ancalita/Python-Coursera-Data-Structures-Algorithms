Binary tree traversals
Problem Introduction
In this problem you will implement in-order, pre-order and post-order traversals of a binary tree.
Problem Description
Task. You are given a rooted binary tree.
Build and output its in-order, pre-order and post-order traversals.
Input Format. The first line contains the number of vertices 𝑛. The vertices of the tree are numbered
from 0 to 𝑛−1. Vertex 0 is the root.
The next 𝑛 lines contain information about vertices 0, 1, ..., 𝑛−1 in order.
Each of these lines contains three integers 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔h𝑡𝑖 — 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 is the key of the 𝑖-th vertex, 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 is the index of the left child of the 𝑖-th vertex, and 𝑟𝑖𝑔h𝑡𝑖 is the index of the right child of the 𝑖-th vertex.
If 𝑖 doesn’t have left or right child (or both), the corresponding 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 or 𝑟𝑖𝑔h𝑡𝑖 (or both) will be equal to −1.
Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105; 0 ≤ 𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑖 ≤ 109; −1 ≤ 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖,𝑟𝑖𝑔h𝑡𝑖 ≤ 𝑛−1.
It is guaranteed that the input represents a valid binary tree.
In particular, if 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 ̸= −1 and 𝑟𝑖𝑔h𝑡𝑖 ̸= −1, then 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡𝑖 ̸= 𝑟𝑖𝑔h𝑡𝑖.
Also, a vertex cannot be a child of two different vertices.
Also, each vertex is a descendant of the root vertex.
Output Format. Print three lines.
The first line should contain the keys of the vertices in the in-order traversal of the tree.
The second line should contain the keys of the vertices in the pre-order traversal of the tree. 
The third line should contain the keys of the vertices in the post-order traversal of the tree.
